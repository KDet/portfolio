# 🌍 Open-Source C++ Version of Vim.Math3D!

> October 13, 2024

[Vim.Math3D](https://github.com/vimaec/Math3D) is an efficient 3D mathematics library originally developed in C# for .NET Standard 2.0 by the [VIM team](https://www.vimaec.com/). The library was designed as a more robust alternative to System.Numerics, eliminating the need for any additional dependencies. The original version is licensed under the **MIT license**.

[This repository](https://github.com/KDet/vim_math3d/tree/develop/src/cpp) contains a translation of Vim.Math3D from C# to C++. The C++ version is a **C++17 header-only** library that preserves all the core advantages of the original, including being lightweight, cross-platform, and free of external dependencies. ✨ The project leverages CMake for build configuration, ensuring straightforward integration across platforms. Additionally, comprehensive unit tests (`using <cassert>`) are included to verify correctness.

If you need an open-source 3D math library that integrates easily into C++ projects, Vim.Math3D may be useful. It’s suitable for a wide range of applications, from game development to physics simulations or any project requiring efficient 3D mathematical computations.
