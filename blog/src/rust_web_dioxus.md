The U.S. government, through [DARPA, plans to translate legacy C code to Rust](https://www.darpa.mil/program/translating-all-c-to-rust) to enhance system security.

## Web Development with Rust and WebAssembly

Rust has rapidly become a go-to language for native web development, especially through [WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly). WebAssembly, co-developed by Mozilla, allows developers to compile Rust code that runs at near-native performance in a web environment while preserving Rust's memory safety features. This makes Rust an excellent choice for [building fast, secure web applications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Rust_to_Wasm).

The Rust ecosystem includes several frameworks that make web development efficient and enjoyable. Below are some of the most popular frameworks for Rust web development: [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/), [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/), [Yew](https://yew.rs/), [Seed](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed), etc. For a detailed comparison of these frameworks, refer to this [comparison table](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2024/table_chrome_129.0.6668.58.html), which outlines metrics like rendering speed, build size, and transferred size. 

Among the listed frameworks, [Dioxus aims to provide a unified development experience across web, desktop, and mobile platforms](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/#introduction). It has features like live hot reloading, server functions, and easy deployment. Its React-inspired design also makes it easy for developers familiar with [React](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/invalid-link-page?url=https%3A%2F%2Freact%2edev%2F&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BQIwogWXUT%2F6vQxKinbW7Hg%3D%3D) to adopt. Also, you can learn more about their plans for native support on [the official roadmap page](https://github.com/dioxuslabs/dioxus/milestones).

## Component in Dioxus

We won't cover the initial setup and first component creation, as you can find a comprehensive guide on the [Dioxus documentation site](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/guide/your_first_component) along with [the full code](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/router/example/full-code).

Since Dioxus supports styling applications using [Tailwind CSS](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/cookbook/tailwind) framework or vanilla CSS, weâ€™ll use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), specifically, [Preline UI's Mini Floating Header](https://www.preline.co/examples/navigations-navbars.html#mini-floating-header) as our example.

- **Converting HTML to RSX with dx translate**

Dioxus uses RSX to represent HTML in Rust code. RSX is concise and idiomatic, but converting HTML manually can be tedious. To streamline this process, Dioxus provides the dx translate command-line tool: 

```
$ dx translate --file index.html
```

This command makes it easy to take HTML and convert it into RSX for further customization in Dioxus.

- **Optimizing and Adding Interactivity to Our Component**

Once we have the RSX, we can optimize our code by using [Manual Props](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/migration/props#manual-props) and create a NavBar component. Props allow to make components more flexible and reusable. For **NavBar**, weâ€™ll add parameters for the navigation items, dark mode, and brand link. We'll also set up [event handlers](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/reference/event_handlers) for user interactions, such as clicking on navigation links or toggling the mobile menu.

To simplify the implementation, we use the following helper crates:

* `dioxus-spring = "0.2.1"`: An animation library for Dioxus. More details are available [here](https://github.com/dioxus-community/dioxus-spring).
* `dioxus-use-mounted = "0.2.1"`: A utility to encapsulate component `MountedData`, which you can find [here](https://github.com/dioxus-community/dioxus-use-mounted/blob/main/src/lib.rs).

Hereâ€™s the complete implementation of the NavBar component:

```rust
#[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct NavItem {
    pub id: &'static str,
    pub title: &'static str,
    pub href: &'static str,
    pub section: UseMounted,
}

#[derive(Props, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct NavBarProps {
    pub darkmode: bool,
    pub menu: Vec<NavItem>,
    pub selected: Option<usize>,
    #[props(into)]
    pub brandlink: NavigationTarget,
    pub icon: Option<Element>,
}

#[component]
pub fn NavBar(props: NavBarProps) -> Element {
    let mut selected_index = use_signal(|| props.selected.unwrap_or(0));

    let mut height = use_signal(|| 0);
    let (spring, spring_ref) = use_spring_signal(height());
    use_memo(move || {
        spring_ref.animate(height(), Duration::from_millis(300));
    });

    let container_ref = use_mounted();

    rsx! {
        nav { class: format_args!("mt-4 relative max-w-2xl w-full mx-2 py-2.5 md:flex md:items-center md:justify-between md:py-0 md:px-4 md:mx-auto border rounded-[2rem] {}", if props.darkmode { "bg-neutral-900 border-neutral-700" } else { "bg-white border-gray-200" }),
            div { class: "px-4 md:px-0 flex justify-between items-center",
                div {  class: "shrink-0",
                    Link { class: "flex-none rounded-md inline-block text-xl font-semibold focus:outline-none focus:opacity-80",
                        to: props.brandlink,
                        if let Some(icon) = props.icon { {icon} } else { icons::AT { darkmode: props.darkmode, class: "mx-2 justify-center" } }
                    }
                }
                div { class: "md:hidden",
                    button { class: format_args!("flex justify-center items-center size-6 border rounded-full focus:outline-none {}", if props.darkmode { "border-neutral-700 text-neutral-400 hover:bg-neutral-700 focus:bg-neutral-700" } else { "border-gray-200 text-gray-500 hover:bg-gray-200 focus:bg-gray-200" }),
                        r#type: "button",
                        onclick: move |_| height.set(if height() > 0 { 0 } else { get_scroll_height(container_ref).unwrap_or(0) }),
                        svg {
                            width: "24",
                            stroke: "currentColor",
                            fill: "none",
                            height: "24",
                            view_box: "0 0 24 24",
                            stroke_width: "2",
                            stroke_linecap: "round",
                            stroke_linejoin: "round",
                            class: "shrink-0 size-3.5",
                            if height() > 0 {
                                path { d: "M18 6 6 18" }
                                path { d: "m6 6 12 12" }
                            } else {
                                line { y2: "6", x2: "21", x1: "3", y1: "6" }
                                line { y1: "12", x1: "3", y2: "12", x2: "21" }
                                line { y1: "18", x2: "21", y2: "18", x1: "3" }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            div { class: format_args!("basis-full grow overflow-hidden md:block {}", if spring() == 0 { "hidden" } else { "" }),
                style: format_args!("{}", if height() != spring() { format!("height: {}px;", spring()) } else { "".into() }),
                onmounted: move |event| container_ref.onmounted(event),
                div { class: "flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-center md:justify-end gap-2 md:gap-3 mt-3 md:mt-0 py-2 md:py-0 md:ps-7",
                    for (i, &nav) in props.menu.iter().enumerate() {
                        Link { class: format_args!("py-0.5 md:py-3 px-4 md:px-1 border-s-2 md:border-s-0 md:border-b-2 focus:outline-none {} {}", if props.darkmode { "border-neutral-200 text-neutral-200" } else { "border-gray-800 text-gray-800" }, if selected_index() == i { "font-medium" } else { "border-transparent" }),
                            to: nav.href,
                            onclick_only: true,
                            onclick: move |_| {
                                selected_index.set(i);
                                scroll_into_view(nav.section);
                            },
                            {nav.title}
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

It refers a **scroll_into_view** function for smooth scrolling to a selected section and a **get_scroll_height** function to calculate the height for the mobile menu. Here's the implementation:

```rust
fn scroll_into_view(mounted: UseMounted) {
    if let Some(element) = &*mounted.signal.read() {
        let _ = element.scroll_to(ScrollBehavior::Smooth);
    }
}

fn get_scroll_height(mounted: UseMounted) -> Option<i32> {
    if let Some(element) = &*mounted.signal.read() {
        if let Some(raw_elem) = element.downcast::<web_sys::Element>() {
            let att = raw_elem.get_attribute("style").unwrap_or_default();
            raw_elem.set_attribute("style", format!("{};display: block;", att).as_str()).unwrap_or_default();
            let height = raw_elem.scroll_height();
            raw_elem.set_attribute("style", att.as_str()).unwrap_or_default();
            return Some(height);
        }
    }
    None
}
```

When development is done, it's time to add some optimizations. You can find more information [here](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/cookbook/optimizing). I use these

```
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
debug = false
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
panic = "abort"
strip = true
incremental = false
```

# Deployment

Dioxus-specific deployment support is coming soon, and you can follow the updates [here](https://dioxuslabs.com/deploy). In the meantime, we can deploy a Dioxus application using Azure Static Web Apps, similar to the steps described [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hosting-flutter-web-app-azure-static-apps-dmytro-kravchyna-pwp9e/?trackingId=emI92qzFTVigexUSzOl68Q%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BQIwogWXUT%2F6vQxKinbW7Hg%3D%3D).

We can also explore community deployment samples from [Dioxus Awesome](https://dioxuslabs.com/awesome). For instance, try deploying using the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) template, as demonstrated in the [dioxus-vercel-demo repository](https://github.com/lucifer1004/dioxus-vercel-demo). Note that I had to modify the deployment instructions slightly to get it working:

Replace:

```yaml
 - name: Install trunk
    if: steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
    uses: actions-rs/cargo@v1
    with:
      use-cross: true
      command: install
      args: trunk

  - name: Build web pages
    run: trunk build --release
```

With:

```yaml
- name: Install Dioxus
    if: steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
    uses: actions-rs/cargo@v1
    with:
      use-cross: true
      command: install
      args: dioxus-cli

  - name: Build web pages
    run: dx build --release
```

The component described here is part of a larger application, which you can view [here](https://dmytro-kravchyna.vercel.app/).
